# Remind

A template for creating a site that sends reminders at a specified time and date. 
Implemented the creation of users and reminders. 
To send SMS or email, you need to implement this module (see lib/remind/send_remind/sending_remind.ex)
Now reminders are displayed in the console.

To start your Phoenix server:
